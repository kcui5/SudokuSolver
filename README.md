Sudoku Solver

An algorithm I wrote to solve sudoku boards while also practicing my Python skills.
Some aspects are purposely less efficient so that I can practice my Python. For example, there are classes created for each set of functionality to practice creating classes, empty lists as board entry placeholders to practice error handling, and others.
